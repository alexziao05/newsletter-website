        <p class="success-section-content-description">May Rafo Shamasha is a first-generation freshman at SDSU, majoring in business management and philosophy while minoring in leadership. Being the only one in her family of 7 to attend college, she is driven and grateful for this opportunity, considering none of her older siblings or her parents had the chance to do so. This deep sense of gratitude has instilled determination and purpose into May as she approaches life at SDSU. Originally from Iraq, she and her family moved to the United States when she was only 8 years old, and though she is now fluent in English, the language barrier initially led her to doubt her own abilities. For a time, she even considered attending a community college instead of a large university like SDSU. Once May looked back on her high school achievements and leadership skills, she realized that she belonged at SDSU.
May is passionate about learning and finds intellectual challenge stimulating. One of her biggest inspirations is her older sister, Ibtihaj, who constantly supports her, reminds her of her goals, and keeps her grounded when times get tough. In just her first year, May has already started working a job on campus, secured an internship, and got involved in an entrepreneurship program. May takes every opportunity to learn and grow, with her main goal while attending SDSU being to absorb as much knowledge as possible to apply to both her future career and personal life. To May, success isn't reserved for just grades and extracurriculars; it is about building meaningful connections and making a difference. By pursuing her passions and using her voice for good, May hopes to contribute to the community in a way that leaves a lasting impact, both during her time at SDSU and beyond.</p>
