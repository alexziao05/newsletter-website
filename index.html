                <p>Feeling stressed? Just need to talk with someone? Counselors from C&PS provide confidential support to SDSU students on a drop-in basis through the Talk It Out program.</p>
                <p>Meet one-on-one with a counselor for 15-20 minutes to get perspective, ask questions, and learn about strategies and resources to address your concerns. Unlike psychotherapy, Talk It Out allows you to speak with a counselor informally to get their professional guidance without an appointment, much like visiting a professor's office hours.</p>
